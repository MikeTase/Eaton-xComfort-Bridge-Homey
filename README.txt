This app lets you control Eaton xComfort devices via the xComfort Bridge.

It supports switching and dimming actuators, room control with aggregated status, shading control (open/close/stop with optional position), thermostat setpoints, and wall switch button events.

Configuration: Open App Settings in Homey, enter the Bridge IP Address and Bridge Auth Key (found on the back of the bridge), and the app will connect automatically. For stability, reserve the bridge IP in your router (DHCP reservation).

Adding devices: Open the Devices tab, click Add Device, choose Eaton xComfort, pick a device type, then wait for the list to load and select devices to add. Supported device types include Actuator or Dimmer, Room (xComfort), Shading or Blinds, Thermostat or Heating, and Wall Switch.

Troubleshooting: Ensure the Bridge works in the official Eaton app, verify the IP address and Auth Key, and confirm the bridge is reachable on your Homey network.
